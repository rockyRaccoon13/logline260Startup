[My class notes](notes.md)

**_Logline_** is a web app that allows users to log, share, and read short 1-2 line film reviews. Users can read through the newest reviews as well as look back on their own previous reviews or their friend's.

### Elevator pitch

Would you like to share your enthusiasm for a particular movie with your friends? Want to know that people are saying about the latest blockbuster? The _Logline_ application allows you to read and publish short reviews on new and classic films.

### Design

The startup has 5 pages:

1. Register/Login - regiser/login page. includes a random movie quote under startup logo
2. Reviews - this is where the latest reviews are listed
3. ViewProfile - this is where a user can view their own profile (from nav bar) or another user's profile (linked from a review)
4. EditProfile - this is where a user can edit their own profile -- add a bio, name (maybe allow to change username?)
5. PublishReview - this is where a user can create a new review

    box user browser
    actor user
    end

    box myApp
    participant Server
    end

    box friends' browsers
    actor friends
    end

    friends->>Server: publish review / edit profile
    user->>Server: publish review / edit profile
    Server->>user:  send recent reviews / profile
```

### Key features

- User can publish their own movie review
- User can view page of latest reviews
- User can view user profiles and edit their own

- Ability to like a review

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Hyperlinks to navigate pages.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, and uses good whitespace, coloring choices, and contrast.
- **React** - Description here
- **Service**
  - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - retrieving reviews/profiles
    - submitting new reviews
    - editing user profile
  - Third party service for getting random movie quote
- **DB/Login** - DB stores user profiles, reviews. Registering user adds them to DB which securely stores login credentials. User's can't publish review unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - User receives an alert when one of their reviews gets a like.

Since everything is saved to local storage multiple users can login (at separate times of course) and view/edit/like reviews/profiles.

Only the login and browse reviews pages are available to all users (however unauthorized users cannot like reviews). Everything else must be accessed by an authorized user.
